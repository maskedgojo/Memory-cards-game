# 🃏 Memory Cards Game in Java

This project is a simple and interactive **Memory Cards Game** developed using **Java Swing**. The game challenges players to test and improve their memory skills by matching pairs of hidden cards. It provides a fun and engaging user interface along with essential gameplay features like delayed card reveal, error tracking, and a restart option.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

The goal of the game is to match all pairs of identical cards on the board. Cards are displayed face-down and shuffled randomly at the start of each game. Players can flip two cards at a time by clicking on them. If the cards match, they remain face-up. If not, they are flipped back down after a short delay.

The game continues until all cards are matched.
